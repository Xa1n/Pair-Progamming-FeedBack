## Pair Feedback

### Name:(Simon) Chenbo Yi

Feedback: I really enjoyed the pairing session with Xian. We had not only solved the challenges but also discussed the process, concepts and skills to approach the solutions. We shifted our driver and navigator roles for each task and we had a real ping pong game as refreshment. Xian demonstrated his solid understanding of Ruby fundamentals, more importantly, he know how to effectively and efficiently tackle the problems. Further, he can explain the concepts and problems clearly,  even I am not a native English speaker and new to ruby, I can easily understand and learn from him.         


### Name: Sarpong Abasimi

Feedback: Xain is like a teacher, he is able to communicate and explain with simple words what we were required to achieve in the challenges we worked on. He is a good communicator, a great pair partner and certainly gave me diferent perspertive on how to approach and solve problems. I wish I could pair with him every day. That is how good he is.

### Name: Scott Hall

Feedback: Xain and I worked on a project together, Xain was further ahead of where I was from the previous day and took the time to go through the taks from a previous day with me, He didn't just rush through them because he knew the answer, he took time to ensure that I also understood the approach to the project tasks and even took time to go over stuff again that I didn't understand. He has a good sound approach to Engineering problems, including making minor changes to snippets of code just to ensure they do/don't work in testing to make sure his methodology works soundly.

### Name: Sejin Kim

Feedback: Xain is a great pair partner to work with, I learned how to face a problem step by step starting from writing them down on actual paper and to see it from different perspective. He is a patient listener with attention to detail — Just because the test passes, doesn’t mean he just leaves the things that he doesn’t understand. He makes it sure that he can tackle those problems in the future. Great problem solver.

### Name: Gui Heurich

Feedaback: Xain and I worked together during the first day of the Oystercard challenge. It was great to pair with Xain. He was really respectful of my own way of coding, while at the same time giving me insights into his own way of thinking. He has an approach that is not easily satisfied with a simple answer and tryies to go deep into understanding an issue. That is a very good skill to have. Looking forward to pairing again!

### Name: Dominic White

Feedback: A really great pairing session yesterday Xain. Our structure did not really follow driver/navigator roles, but we seemed to work well with a natural approach working together. Your explanations were brilliant, very patient and communication was clear when providing reasoning for a certain action / approach. I felt comfortable being able to speak out if I did not understand something as we were moving at a steady pace giving me the opportunity to absorb the information. Even though we finished the day with a couple of failing tests, I took a lot away from the session and it was a pleasure to work together. I look forward to our next pairing session!

### Name: Callum Marshall

Feedback: I had a really good afternoon pairing with Xain, working with him is very enjoyable. He is methodical in his approach to coding and very patient in his approach to pairing. Xain is a good communicator, we had good discussion about the challenge and how we would go about solving it. Input was encouraged and while we didn't follow the driver/navigator roles, we did share ideas and worked together effectively. I particularly enjoyed his openness to experimentation and feature testing.
