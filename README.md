## Pair Feedback

### Name: Sarpong Abasimi

Feedback: Xain is like a teacher, he is able to communicate and explain with simple words what we were required to achieve in the challenges we worked on. He is a good communicator, a great pair partner and certainly gave me diferent perspertive on how to approach and solve problems. I wish I could pair with him every day. That is how good he is.

### Name: Scott Hall

Feedback: Xain and I worked on a project together, Xain was further ahead of where I was from the previous day and took the time to go through the taks from a previous day with me, He didn't just rush through them because he knew the answer, he took time to ensure that I also understood the approach to the project tasks and even took time to go over stuff again that I didn't understand. He has a good sound approach to Engineering problems, including making minor changes to snippets of code just to ensure they do/don't work in testing to make sure his methodology works soundly.
