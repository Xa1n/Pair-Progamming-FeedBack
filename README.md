## Pair Feedback

### Name: Sarpong Abasimi

Feedback: Xain is like a teacher, he is able to communicate and explain with simple words what we were required to achieve in the challenges we worked on. He is a good communicator, a great pair partner and certainly gave me diferent perspertive on how to approach and solve problems. I wish I could pair with him every day. That is how good he is.

### Name: Scott Hall

Feedback: Xain and I worked on a project together, Xain was further ahead of where I was from the previous day and took the time to go through the taks from a previous day with me, He didn't just rush through them because he knew the answer, he took time to ensure that I also understood the approach to the project tasks and even took time to go over stuff again that I didn't understand. He has a good sound approach to Engineering problems, including making minor changes to snippets of code just to ensure they do/don't work in testing to make sure his methodology works soundly. 

### Name: Sejin Kim

Feedback: Xain is a great pair partner to work with, I learned how to face a problem step by step starting from writing them down on actual paper and to see it from different perspective. He is a patient listener with attention to detail — Just because the test passes, doesn’t mean he just leaves the things that he doesn’t understand. He makes it sure that he can tackle those problems in the future. Great problem solver.
